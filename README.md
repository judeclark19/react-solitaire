1:05:22 AM: 72:6 Warning: React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency: "setWinHistory". Either include it or remove the dependency array. react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
1:05:22 AM: 84:32 Warning: Assignments to the "lastKnownOrientation" variable from inside React Hook useEffect will be lost after each render. To preserve the value over time, store it in a useRef Hook and keep the mutable value in the ".current" property. Otherwise, you can move this variable directly inside useEffect.
