11:28:46 PM: 81:6 Warning: React Hook useEffect has an unnecessary dependency: "appState.winCount". Either exclude it or remove the dependency array. Outer scope values like "appState.winCount" aren"t valid dependencies because mutating them doesn"t re-render the component. react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
11:28:46 PM: 93:32 Warning: Assignments to the "lastKnownOrientation" variable from inside React Hook useEffect will be lost after each render. To preserve the value over time, store it in a useRef Hook and keep the mutable value in the ".current" property. Otherwise, you can move this variable directly inside useEffect. react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
